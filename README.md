# LEX IMPACT

Welcome to **LEX IMPACT** - a unified platform designed to **enpower Africans** to excel in Artificial Intelligence through **edducation, access to local data sets and compute resources**

## Overview
**LEX IMPACT** brings together three critical pillars inot one seamless platform:

- **Academy :** Learn AI from beginner to expert through curated courses, mentorship, and hands-on projects tailored African realities.
- **Data Center :** Access rich, diverse and high quality African datasets, essential for building relevant and impactful AI models.
- **Compute Resources :** Get access to cloud-based compute power for training AI models-breaking barries and hardware limitations

Our mission is to **democratise AI** across Africa by providing the tools, data, and knowlege needed to **create African solutions for African problems**

## Features
**Academy**
- Structured AI curriculum
- Mentorship and community support
- Hands-on projects and real-world challenges
